# ReadAbility
In a code, we'll see the following parts when we consider reading others codes. Its the simplest way of assesing Code Quality and fixing it.


+ Formatting
+ Varible Names
+ Function names
+ Number of Function Arguments
+ Function length
+ Nested loops in a Function

1. Use prettier to make code formats understandable, in order to save time & money.
2. Use meaningful variable & function names, which clearly explains what it does.
3. In functions, take the arguments upto 3, if we consider more than 3, its hard to refactor the code latter.
4. A Function should perform ONE & Only ONE task at a time, avoid doing lot of things at a Time.
5. Use 2 nested loops in a function, Avoid using more than 2, cuz it leads to poor performance of a "For Loop" in order to understand the code
